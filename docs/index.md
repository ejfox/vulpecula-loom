# Vulpecula Chat

A Second Brain for Your AI

## Not Just Another AI Interface

Every conversation is stored in plain-text markdown, so you can edit, search, and organize it like any other file. Your chat history is yoursâ€”and it's actually useful.

```bash
~/.vulpecula/chats/
  2024-01/
    debugging-session.md
    feature-planning.md
  recipes/
    code-review.json
    brainstorm.json
```

## @Everything Integration

Quickly reference files, notes, and context with @ commands:

```bash
@file:roadmap.md      # Pull in project files
@obsidian:notes/      # Reference your notes
@recipe:debug         # Load context recipes
```

## Dynamic Context Control

```bash
:context +tool:API 0.8    # Boost API knowledge
:context -memory 0.2      # Reduce past chat influence
:debug                    # See what your AI knows
```

## Switch Models, Keep Context

```bash
:model gpt-4         # Switch to GPT-4
:model claude        # Switch to Claude
:export markdown     # Save chat as markdown
```
